# Setting Up A Blog

There are a ton of services to use for blogging, but one of my favorites is [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/). Go there and set up a new blog if you don't already have one. One of the toughest things with any blog is posting code snippets. You'll be doing this a lot. Here is how to do it in Wordpress.

## Posting Code Snippets

This feature is a bit hidden which is annoying. The way to add code snippets into your blog requires you clicking on the "Text" button on the top right of the edit screen. You should now see the HTML code behind your post. This may be a bit hard to read but you should be able to see your content. Adding code is as simple as writing the following into that text window:

```
[code language="objc"]
NSString *test = @"Hello World";
[/code]
```

Yank out the `NSString *test = @"Hello World";` and put in what you'd like to write.

Try it out!
