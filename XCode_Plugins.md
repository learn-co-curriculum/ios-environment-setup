# XCode Plugins

There are a ton of xcode plugins that make working with XCode amazing.

## Plugin Manager

First things first, install a xcode plugin manager called [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/).

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/master/Scripts/install.sh | sh
```

restart XCode.

## Installing Plugins

Go to `Window > Package Manager` in XCode. You now can see A TON of packages. Here are some of my favorites:

  - AdjustFontSize
  - BBUFullIssueNavigator
  - FuzzyAutocomplete
  - KSImageNamed
  - ShowInGithub
  - XAlign
  - Solarized
  - Polychromatic
